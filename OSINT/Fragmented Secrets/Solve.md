## Solution
The provided video contained **43 QR codes** flashing quickly over ~20 seconds.  
I took screenshots of each frame containing a QR code and decoded them individually.

After decoding, I combined the fragments into a single string:

### Q1lCRVJDT05fMjAyNXs1M2NyMzc1XzFuX3FyX2MwZDN9


Then decoded it from **Base64**, revealing the final flag.
