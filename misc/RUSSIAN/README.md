##  Solution
There was an anime girl pic given in the attachment and no other information. So I used **[AperiSolve]** to find the inside strings, and I found:
###`Fwiy{4ly4_50x371u35_z1d35_h3c_n33d1n65_1n_cc5514f}`

But it didn’t match the format and I couldn’t read the text.  

---

Then I tried to make it human readable text and found:  

###  `ALYA SOCIETIES SIDES HEC NEEDINGS IN CLASSIFIED `


---

Which still didn’t make sense. But something about “Alya” stuck in my head. Out of curiosity, I threw it into Google. It led me straight to an anime titled 

###  `Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian `

---

Finally, I converted it into the flag format and got the final flag. I reshaped the text to fit the flag format, keeping the leetspeak intact and the hidden message revealed itself.
